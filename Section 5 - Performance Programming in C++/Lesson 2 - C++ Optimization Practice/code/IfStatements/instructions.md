# If Statements Exercise

The IfStatements folder contains the current exercise. The exercise code is in main.cpp. To run the code, use the following commands:

cd /home/workspace/IfStatements
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out

The code cycles through a series of if statements and then cycles through the same series again. You'll see a comment that says "optimize the if statements below". Change the bottom version of the code and see if you can get it to run faster by changing the order of the if statements. 

Because the compiler and CPU try to optimize if statements as well, you might not get much of a difference. Be sure to execute the code multiple times to see if your optimized version is running faster or not.

In the IfStatements folder, You'll find a solution.cpp file.
